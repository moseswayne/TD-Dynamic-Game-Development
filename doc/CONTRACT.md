# Team ILoveSingletons Contract:

### Goals:
Our primary goal in the construction of this team and this contract is the successful design and implementation of a well designed and extensible Tower Defense game that follows design patterns and principles learned throughout the year. In writing this contract, we expect each other to put forth our best work and to make decisions from the point of view of the team rather than ourselves. We hope to grow in our capacity to work in teams, in our capacity to work through adversity, and in our capacity to design and implement computer programs.

### Basic Guidelines:

- We agree to respect each other in our own personal perceptions and ideas of what composes good design
- We agree to always allow for meaningful discussion of any design detail that we are implementing
- We agree to communicate with the team and each other about any difficulties encountered in order to address potential problems as early as possible
- We agree to consult the team about any possible changes to the design
- We agree to attend meetings to the best of our ability and to always make an effort to catch up on any information that might have been missed.
- We agree to complete all assigned tasks in a timely manner and to communicate with other members when this may not be the case.
- We all promise to put forward our best work and to try our hardest on this project

### Overarching Decisions:

We have agreed that the quality of product that we intend to produce should reflect our highest capabilities and we expect each team member to work accordingly to achieve that goal. We have agreed to communicate through the primary group message and with each other for any and all issues that may arise in order to address them early on. We intend to meet once a day for the duration of this project to ensure maximum communication and coordination of tasks and to ensure that everyone's needs are met, whether that be help or additional work. Subteams are accountable for discrepancies within their individual modules, but we agree that individual accountability is important. We intend to assist each other in any way possible, but require accountability for our own actions.
