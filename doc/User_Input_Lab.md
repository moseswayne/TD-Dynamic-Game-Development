## Gideon's Comments

Naming for different upgradables is vague in authoring

right cick to end path is vague

clearing mid path authoring causes problems

The projectile editor is awkwar because you don;t ever spawn projectiles

Going to the next level changes path/background

Have level be more dependent on one another

## Sarah's Comments

Properties are displayed as their class names. Perhaps need more readable names

Editing level data only pops up when the text is clicked. Should make the entire class clickable.

Need back buttons.

Should have info about the features pop up when hovered over.
